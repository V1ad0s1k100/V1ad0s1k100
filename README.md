Hi! My name is Vlad, and I study at the Aerospace College at the Siberian State University of Science and Technology. I like frontend, especially JavaScript coding. I am currently studying in the specialty "Information security of automated systems".

I want to develop in website creation, that's why I'm here. I use such tools:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Pronouns**: He/his
